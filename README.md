WraithQuest
===========

A completely cross-platform quest logger primarily for Minecraft custom maps.

## FEATURES

* Cross-platform: Due to the program being built in Java for Minecraft, it will run on all platforms that may need it.
* Easily create quests: Writing a quest line is very simple, and with the possible release of a dev version, it will only become simpler.
* Support for cutscenes: If needed, the map developer can include links to YouTube cutscenes or conversations.
